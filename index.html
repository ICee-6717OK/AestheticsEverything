      <p>If you ask me what my favorite tv show ever is, I'd ask you if you mean it's a show I'd have a tatoo on my back about and even name myy kids after it. If by any chance your answer is yes, then I'd tell you it's <strong>Rick and Morty</strong>. This show by Justin Roiland is a combination of humour, sci-fi, drama and plain fun for the viewers. The plot is based on an old scientist, <i>Rick Sanchez</i>. After having been missing for nearly 20 years, Rick Sanchez suddenly arrives at daughter Beth's doorstep to move in with her and her family. Although Beth welcomes Rick into her home, her husband, Jerry, isn't as happy about the family reunion. Jerry is concerned about Rick, a sociopathic scientist, using the garage as his personal laboratory. In the lab, Rick works on a number of sci-fi gadgets, some of which could be considered dangerous. But that's not all Rick does that concerns Jerry. He also goes on adventures across the universe that often involve his grandchildren, <i>Morty</i> and <i>Summer</i>.</p>
